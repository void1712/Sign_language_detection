# Sign_language_detection
what is sign language detection ?

Sign Language Recognition (shortened generally as SLR) is a computational task that involves recognizing actions from sign languages.
This is an essential problem to solve especially in the digital world to bridge the communication gap that is faced by people with hearing impairments.

This project detects the hand sign made in American Sign Language and gives the output as which letter is made by hand sign.

The prerequisites software & libraries for the sign language project are:

Python (3.7.4)
IDE (Jupyter)
Numpy (version 1.16.5)
cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
Keras (version 2.3.1)
Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
